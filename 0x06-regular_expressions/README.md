# 0x06. Regular expression

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.”   Now they have two problems. (super classic joke in the industry)

### What Are Regular Expressions?

A regular expression a.k.a. “regexp”, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.  It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.
