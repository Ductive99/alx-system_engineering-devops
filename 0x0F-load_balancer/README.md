# Load Balancer

When I work with web server, I like to imagine servers in a cafe or in a restaurant. Let's take for example a cafe that has lots of clients and at least 2 servers that deliver request that clients have. During peak hours, when many clients arrive at once, you might find that the servers are overwhelmed with orders, causing delays in service.

To address this, a system needs to be set at the entrance of the caf√© to evenly ditribte the incoming clients among the available servers based on their current load and capacity. Let's call this system "Load Balancing".

Which handles 4 key features:
- Client/Request Arrival
- Load Assesment (Monitoring)
- Even Distribution (Load Balancing)
- Dynamic Adjustement (Dynamic Load Balancing)
